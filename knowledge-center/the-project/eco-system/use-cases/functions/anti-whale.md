# Anti-Whale

**Anti-whale functions** are an **important extra security layer to a farm**. They **limit** big players (whales or malicious developers) to **dump** or **pump** huge amounts of their token by setting a **maximum sell/buy limit**.

The [**Anti-Whale function**](../../../../glossary-and-vocab.md) is right now set to **0.1%** of the Total Supply which equals **1 billion tokens**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**The** [**Anti-Whale function**](../../../../glossary-and-vocab.md) applies on all transactions; **buy**, **sell** and **transfer.**
