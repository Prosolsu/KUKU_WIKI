# Binance Smart Chain

_**Why we choose Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**_

Far most for it's **Advance Security** advantages.\
**BSC** uses the [**The Proof-of-Staked-Authority (PoSA)**](../glossary-and-vocab.md) mechanism to achieve **Network Consensus** and maintain **Blockchain Security**.\
**PoSA**, as applied by the network, is a **combination** of [**Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)**](../glossary-and-vocab.md) and [**Proof-of-Authority (PoA)**](../glossary-and-vocab.md). \
Furthermore, **staking models are more environmentally friendly** and **support faster block generation**.&#x20;

_**BSC Advantages**_ :arrow\_double\_down:

**Transaction Speed**\
BSC is currently one of the **fastest smart contract platforms**, contributing to its fast growth. Blocks are generated every **3 seconds** **compared** to **Ethereum’s 13 seconds**, making it at least **four times faster**.

**Low Gas Fees**\
It currently costs an average of **5** [**Gwei**](../glossary-and-vocab.md) to process a transaction on **BSC**, which is far cheaper than the **40** [**Gwei**](../glossary-and-vocab.md) charged on **Ethereum**. That is an **8x cheaper** price tag to run a [**dApp**](../glossary-and-vocab.md) on BSC than running the same app on **Ethereum**.&#x20;

**Cross-Chain Compatibility** \
Not only is BSC **compatible** with Ethereum virtual machine (**EVM**), it also supports pegged coins from several other blockchains allowing users to create several tokens to use on the network. **Cross-chain compatibility** increases token **liquidity**, **utility**, and **value**.&#x20;

**EVM Compatibility**\
Choosing to fork the Geth **Ethereum** client makes **BSC** more familiar to Solidity developers, which gives the **Binance** network easy access to an already vibrant community of developers and users. Additionally, since it’s cheaper to run **dApps** on **BSC**, it makes it easy to **port applications** over from **Ethereum**, which is **faster** and **cheaper** to **execute**.&#x20;

**Credible Platform and Company** \
**Binance** is one of the most popular exchanges, and its credibility is shared across all its platforms, including the **BSC**. The exchange also plays an important role in the **PoSA consensus** by **vetting all validators** on the network, **ensuring** that the **blockchain** is **secure** and **reliable**.
