# Tax System

KUKU is a [**Deflationary** ](../../knowledge-center/glossary-and-vocab.md)Token, meaning we apply a Tax System to always push the price up by Burning. \
In return we contribute and fund our [**Charity Foundation**](../../knowledge-center/the-project/charity-foundation.md).\
We apply a 5% Tax on all Transfer & Sell actions.

{% hint style="success" %}
KUKU holders are [**Automatically Rewarded**](../../knowledge-center/the-project/use-cases/functions/auto-rewards.md) with 1% over every Transfer and Sell action.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
We have an [**Anti-Whale Function**](../../knowledge-center/the-project/use-cases/functions/anti-whale.md) built in which is currently set to 0.1% (1 Billion Tokens) of the Total Supply.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When Selling KUKU on our panKUKU DEX, please set the slippage tolerance to max 6%.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When Selling KUKU on PancakeSwap DEX, please set the slippage tolerance to 15%. The Slippage is higher on PancakeSwap to encourage user to trade on our own platform.
{% endhint %}

**Our 5% Tax is divided as follows:**

| Factor                  | % |
| ----------------------- | - |
| Team                    | 1 |
| Auto Rewards to Holders | 1 |
| Auto Liquidity Provider | 1 |
| Charity                 | 1 |
| Burn                    | 1 |

{% hint style="success" %}
We re-evaluate our Tax-System every quarter to maintain a justified model of in- en outcome.
