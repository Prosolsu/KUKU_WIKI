# Tax System

KUKU is a Deflationary Token, meaning we apply a Tax System to always push the price up by Burning. \
In return we can contribute and fund our Charity Foundation.\
We apply a 5% Tax on all Transfer & Sell actions.

{% hint style="success" %}
KUKU holders are automatically rewarded with 1% over every Transfer and Sell action.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When Selling our token on our DEX or Pancakeswap, please set the slippage tolerance to 5 or 6 %.
{% endhint %}

**Our 5% Tax is divided as follows:**

| Factor                  | % |
| ----------------------- | - |
| Team                    | 1 |
| Auto Rewards to Holders | 1 |
| Auto Liquidity Provider | 1 |
| Charity                 | 1 |
| Burn                    | 1 |

{% hint style="success" %}
We will re-evaluate our Tax-System every quarter to maintain a justified model of in- en outcome
{% endhint %}
