# Tax System

KUKU is a Deflationary Token, meaning we apply a Tax System to always push the price up by Burning. \
In return we contribute and fund our Charity Foundation.\
We apply a 5% Tax on all Transfer & Sell actions.

{% hint style="success" %}
KUKU holders are [**Automatically Rewarded**](../../knowledge-center/the-project/use-cases/auto-reward-to-holders.md) with 1% over every Transfer and Sell action.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
We have an [**Anti-Whale Function**](../../knowledge-center/the-project/use-cases/anti-whale-function.md) built in which is currently set to 1% (1 Bil. Tokens) of the Total Supply.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When Selling our token on our DEX or Pancakeswap, please set the slippage tolerance between 5 to 6 %. (e.g slippage 5.1%)
{% endhint %}

**Our 5% Tax is divided as follows:**

| Factor                  | % |
| ----------------------- | - |
| Team                    | 1 |
| Auto Rewards to Holders | 1 |
| Auto Liquidity Provider | 1 |
| Charity                 | 1 |
| Burn                    | 1 |

{% hint style="success" %}
We will re-evaluate our Tax-System every quarter to maintain a justified model of in- en outcome
{% endhint %}
