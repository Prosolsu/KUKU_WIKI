# Tax System

KUKU is Hyper Deflationary Token, meaning we apply a Tax System to always push the price up by Burning.\
In return we can contribute and fund our Charity Foundation.

We apply a 5% Tax on all Transfer & Sell actions.

{% hint style="info" %}
When Selling our token on our DEX or Pancakeswap, please set the slippage tolerance to 6%.
{% endhint %}

Our Tax is divided as follows:

1. Team       :    2 %
2. Auto LP  :    1 %
3. Charity   :    1 %
4. Burn       :     1 %
