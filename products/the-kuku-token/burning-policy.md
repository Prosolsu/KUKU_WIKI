# Burning Policy

We have an **Automated** [**Burn**](../../knowledge-center/glossary-and-vocab.md) **System**, applied through a tax model when transferring or selling KUKU tokens.\
Apart from our Automated [**Burn**](../../knowledge-center/glossary-and-vocab.md) System, we initiate **Manual Mass Burns**. Just for good measure and giving true meaning to a **Hyper Deflationary Token**.

**Automated Burn Rate**\
1% on every transfer and sell action

**Mass Burn Rate**\
****Every quarter a certain % over the Total Supply

**Initial Burn**\
****2% of the Total Supply: 20 billion tokens - 20,000,000,000
