# Burning Policy

We have an automated burn system, applied through a tax model when transferring or selling KUKU tokens.\
Apart from our automated burn system, we will initiate manual mass burns, just for good measure and giving true meaning to a Hyper Deflationary Token.

**Automated Burn Rate**\
1% on every transfer and sell action

**Mass Burn Rate**\
****Every quarter between 1% and 5% over the Total Supply (Burned tokens excluded)

**Initial Burn**\
****1% of the total Supply: 10 billion tokens - 10,000,000,000

**Burn Address**\
[0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead](https://bscscan.com/token/0x84Fd7CC4Cd689fC021eE3D00759B6D255269D538?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)
